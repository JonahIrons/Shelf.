# Shelf.
Your books. Your Shelf.

## Motivation
My purpose for developing this project started with a project assignment in my Relational Databases course at Purdue University. I was tasked with creating a web app backed by a SQL database (with other conditions applying). I knew this was a perfect opportunity to create a full stack project that I could proudly display, so I decided to put some substantial effort into creating a polished and convenient application - particularly one that I could see myself using.

## Technologies
This project is a REACT app, utilizing Node.js and a MySQL database. This app also depends on the OpenLibrary public API, which is a great resource for accessing information on millions of books, completely free. This is my first React app, so I was learning as I developed - I'm sure my earlier code will stick out compared to the later code in this project.

## Design
All design choices were my own decisions. From color palette to font, logo, and site navigation, all choices were made with the intent of making an application that is ultimately simple to use. I was inspired by *Letterboxd* style lists and reviews, but wanted to adapt this specifically for books.

I'm aware that there are many other services that allow for cultivation of book lists and reviews - however, I wanted to gain experience integrating APIs in my app, and books happen to be a convenient passion of mine.
